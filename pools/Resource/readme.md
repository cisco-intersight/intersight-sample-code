## Resource Pool
A resource pool is an aggregation of homogeneous resources that are managed in Intersight. A resource pool enables you to manage the utilization of resources for certain Intersight features like Server Profile. Currently, Intersight supports only server type as a resource for the resource pool.

Resource pool enables you to logically group and manage resources (servers) more efficiently. You can assign servers to a resource pool and can continue with the automated server profile assignment.
