## BootOrder Policy
Configures the linear ordering of devices and enables you to change the boot order and boot mode. You can also add multiple devices under various device types, rearrange the boot order, and set parameters for each boot device type.

The inventory view enables you to view the actual boot order configured on a server. The boot order displays the details that include device name, device type, configuration details such as Boot Mode (Legacy or UEFI), and Secure Boot Mode (Enabled or Disabled).
