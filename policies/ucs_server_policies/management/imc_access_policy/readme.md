##  IMC Access Policy
Enables you to configure and manage your network through mapping of IP pools to the server profile. This policy allows you to configure a VLAN and associate it with an IP address through the IP pool address.
In-Band IP addresses, Out-Of-Band IP addresses, or both can be configured using the IMC Access Policy. vKVM, IPMI, SOL, and vMedia using vKVM client can be used with either In-Band or Out-Of-Band IP addresses. SNMP, vMedia, and Syslog are currently supported only with In-band IP address and not with Out-Of-Band IP address.
