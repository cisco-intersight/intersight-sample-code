## Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Policy
Configures the SNMP settings for sending fault and alert information by SNMP traps from the managed devices. Any existing SNMP Users or SNMP Traps configured previously on the managed devices are removed and replaced with users or traps that you configure in this policy. If you have not added any users or traps in the policy, the existing users or traps on the server are removed but not replaced.
