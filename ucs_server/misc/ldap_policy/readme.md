## LDAP Policy
Specifies the LDAP configuration settings and preferences for an endpoint. The endpoints support LDAP to store and maintain directory information in a network. The LDAP policy determines configuration settings for LDAP Servers, DNS parameters including options to obtain a domain name used for the DNS SRV request, Binding methods, Search parameters, and Group Authorization preferences. Through an LDAP policy, you can also create multiple LDAP groups and add them to the LDAP server database.
