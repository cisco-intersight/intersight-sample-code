## LAN Connectivity Policy
Determines the connections and the network communication resources between the server and the LAN on the network. You must create the Ethernet Adapter, Ethernet QoS, and Ethernet Network policies as part of the LAN connectivity policy. For IMM servers, use a MAC pool, or static MAC addresses, to assign MAC addresses to servers and to identify the vNICs that the servers use to communicate with the network
