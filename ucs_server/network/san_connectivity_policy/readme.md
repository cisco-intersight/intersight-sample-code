## SAN Connectivity Policy
Determines the network storage resources and the connections between the server and the SAN on the network. This policy enables you to configure vHBAs that the servers use to communicate with the Storage Area Network. You can use WWPN and WWNN address pools, or static WWPN and WWNN addresses, to add vHBAs and to configure them. You must create the Fibre Channel Adapter, Fibre Channel QoS, and Fibre Channel Network policies as part of the SAN connectivity policy.
